## Under the hood of program compilation and execution
* From high-level programs to machine code
    * What are .h, .o and .cpp file?
    * What is an execuatble 
    * Steps in compilation
    * Creating object files and linking programs with g++
* Separate compilation with Makefiles [read about Makefile](https://foo.cs.ucsb.edu/16wiki/index.php/C%2B%2B:_Separate_Compilation_and_Makefiles)
* Compile-time errors
* Linker errors
* Header guards


# Topics
