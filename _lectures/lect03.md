You should change the quality to the highest setting. And I'm sorry that I say "uh" a lotâ€”at least you can watch at twice the speed and get it over with!

# Topics

## Working with doubles
* Evaluating expressions with mixed numeric types
* Typecasting int to double 
* Formatted output with doubles:

Comment each line of code. What is the output of the code?
```
int i = 10;
double j = 1/static_cast<double>(i);
cout.setf(ios::fixed);
cout.setf(ios::showpoint);
cout.precision(3);
cout<<j<<endl;
```
## Practice with single for loops
* Summing a series: 

**Exercise: Write a program that takes a parameter n as a command line arguments and computes the following:**

```
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ....+ 1/n
```
where n is the number of terms in the series. Sample run of the program is below:

```
$./sumSeries 2
Sum of the first 2 terms is: 1.500
```
## Nested Loops

**Math Puzzle**

One of the powers of computing is being able to do a brute-force search for a solution to a problem. Trial and error works just fine for some problems. In fact, computers can be especially good at such problems. Consider this:

Horses cost $10, pigs cost $3, and rabbits are only $0.50. A farmer buys 100 animals for $100, How many of each animal did he buy?  

Write a program to do this.
