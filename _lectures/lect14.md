# Topics

* Thinking recursively about problems on sequences
* Recursion vs. iteration via examples: printing elements of an array in order, summing elements of a linked-list
* Order is very important: one line in the wrong spot makes you print the elements in reverse order


* How do we know our recursive solution is correct? Proof by induction
* Is recursive better than iterative?
* Problems that have a naturally recursive solution
* Under the hood of recursive functions (how recursive functions use the stack)
* Helper functions
* Recursion on strings
* Linked-list problems - freeing all nodes in a linked-list


* Deleting a single node in the linked-list (recursive)
* Deleting all nodes in the linked-list (highlight issues with dynamic memory management)


* char arrays, C-strings and string literals
* Basic operations on C-Strings s
* String class objects and methods (similarities and differences with c-strings)
* Understanding the problems for lab08 - isAnagram
