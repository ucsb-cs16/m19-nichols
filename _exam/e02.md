## Instructions for the exam

* You may bring one *handwritten* 8.5" x 11" piece of paper with notes on both sides. This paper will be collected along with your exam, so make your own copy if you would like to keep it.
* No calculators or phones are allowed in the exam  
* There are no makeups for this exam 
* You must write your name on every single sheet of paper including your notes
* We will provide you with scratch paper
* The format of the exam will be similar to Midterm 1

## Topics Covered 

The emphasis is on files, pointers, references, arrays, structs, and pointers to basic/struct types.

* Lectures up to the exam
* Homeworks 1 to 6
* Labs 0 to 5

### Study Guide

* Memory 
    * Basic model of memory (addressable bytes) 
    * Representing multi-byte data like ints, address of multi-byte variables
    * Program layout in memory during runtime 
    * Interaction of programs with memory

* Data representation:
    * Conversions between difference bases using positional encoding (hex decimal binary)
    * Finding the range of values with fixed numbers of bits for unsigned representation

* Git:
    - Basics of `git` from the command line
    - Adding files to a commit, commiting with a commit message, sending and retrieving information from the remote server, etc.
    
* Arrays:
    * declaration 
    * initialization 
    * representation in memory 
    * accessng elements via index-based and range-based for loops 
    * passing arrays to functions
    * **tracing/writing code involving arrays and showing program dynamics via pointer diagrams** 

* Files:
    - Reading/writing to files using `ifstream`/`ofstream`
    - Appropriately checking for errors/end of file

* Pointers:
    * declaration, size of a pointer
    * initialization to null value, initialization using the '&' operator
    * pointer diagrams showing relationship between pointer and pointee
    * derefencing pointers using the '*' operator
    * assignment involving pointers: making two pointers point to the same object
    * changing where a pointer points to
    * **tracing/writing code involving pointers and showing program dynamics via pointer diagrams** 

* References:
    * Definition
    * Assignment
    * Call by reference
    * Differences between pointers and references
    * **tracing/writing code involving references and showing program dynamics via pointer diagrams** 

* Structs:
    * Defining a struct as a data type 
    * Declaring structs 
    * Accessing memory variables using the dot (.) operator 
    * Pointers to structure (declaration and initialization)
    * References to structures
    * Arrays of structs 
    * Passing structs to functions by value, address, and reference 
    * Passing arrays of structs to functions 
    * **tracing/writing code involving structs, pointers, references to structs, and arrays of structs; and showing program dynamics via pointer diagrams**
